# RecSync PostProcessing

This utility "repairs" the videos generated by the RecSync NG app:
* Videos are unpacked
* Missing frames are injected as black frames
* Videos are re-packed, and they will all hve the same starting frame and the same number of frames
  * Optionally, a frame counter is added


## Installing

Create an environment and install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt`


## Testing

Export an environment variable with the root of your test material and run the `pytest` command.
It is the directory containing the clients subdirs.

```bash
export RECSYNCH_SESSION_DIR=path/to/my/stuff
pytest
```
